# Feature-Selection
The objective of this task is to assess the impact of feature selection on training and test datasets. 

Feature selection is the process of reducing the number of input variables when developing a predictive model.
It is desirable to reduce the number of input variables to both reduce the computational cost of modeling and, in some cases,
to improve the performance of the model.

Two datasets used in this task are SPECT_train.csv and SPECT_test.csv.
The idea is to identify good feature subsets using the training dataset and test these subsets on the test data.
